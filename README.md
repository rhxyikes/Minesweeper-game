# Minesweeper-game
I have built a Minesweeper Game using C++/STL. 
This is a classic Minesweeper game implemented in C++. Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines or bombs without detonating any of them.
FEATURES:
1. Classic Minesweeper gameplay.
2. Adjustable board size and mine count.
3. Keeps track of the number of moves.
4. User-friendly command-line interface.

Before you can run the Minesweeper game, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
1. C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the source code.
